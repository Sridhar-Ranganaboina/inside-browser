#Agent Tiers
#🟢 Tier 1 — Autonomous Agents (Strong Agentic)

These fully satisfy all agentic criteria.

Use Case	Why it qualifies
Regulatory Change Intelligence	Goal + RAG + re-planning
Obligation Diff Agent	Semantic reasoning + memory
Dashboard Anomaly Detection	Learning baseline + self-evaluation
Semantic Monitoring Agent	Time-aware reasoning
Knowledge Drift Detection	Long-term memory

✅ These are unquestionably agentic.

#🟡 Tier 2 — Assistive Agents (Controlled Agentic)

These are still agents, but operate with human oversight.

Use Case	Why still an agent
Investigation Assistant	Goal-driven + reasoning
Evidence Collection Agent	Decides relevance
Human-in-the-loop Review Agent	Knows when to stop
Workflow Documentation Agent	Learns + abstracts

⚠️ They are agents, but not autonomous.

This is perfectly acceptable in enterprise AI.

#🔵 Tier 3 — Agentic Capabilities (NOT standalone agents)

These should NOT be marketed as independent agents.

Capability	Why not standalone
Functional Test Generation	Tool invoked by agent
Regression Classification	Sub-agent / skill
RAG Search	Capability
Screenshot Capture	Skill

Call these:

“Agentic skills” or “Sub-agents”

This avoids over-claiming.




#📌 Sample Agentic AI Use Cases for the Platform
1️⃣ Regulatory & Compliance Use Cases (High Enterprise Value)
1. Regulatory Change Intelligence Agent

Goal

Identify and explain regulatory changes impacting firm products, jurisdictions, or obligations.

Agentic traits

Monitors multiple regulator portals

Compares with historical memory (RAG)

Determines relevance (not just change)

Explains impact with confidence score

Why agentic (not automation)
Semantic reasoning + historical comparison + self-evaluation.

2. Regulatory Obligation Diff Agent

Goal

Compare latest circulars / rules against previous versions and highlight meaningful changes.

Agentic traits

Semantic diff (not text diff)

Cross-document reasoning

Stops early if no material change

3. Policy-to-Regulation Alignment Agent

Goal

Check whether internal policy documents align with external regulatory updates.

Agentic traits

Ingests internal docs + regulator docs

Uses RAG to reason across sources

Flags gaps and ambiguities

2️⃣ Financial / Risk / Market Use Cases (Read-only, Safe)
4. Dashboard Anomaly Detection Agent

Goal

Observe risk or exposure dashboards and flag unusual patterns.

Agentic traits

Learns baseline behavior from memory

Ignores cosmetic UI changes

Escalates only when confidence threshold crossed

5. Market Disclosure Monitoring Agent

Goal

Detect new disclosures or announcements relevant to firm exposure.

Agentic traits

Watches multiple issuer portals

Filters noise

Explains why a disclosure matters

6. Client Disclosure Validation Agent

Goal

Validate that published disclosures match internal disclosure requirements.

Agentic traits

Reads UI-only portals

Cross-checks against policy memory

Produces audit-ready evidence

3️⃣ Investigation & Audit Support Use Cases
7. Investigation Assistant Agent

Goal

Help investigators understand what changed on a system, portal, or dashboard over time.

Agentic traits

Navigates UI historically

Uses screenshots + RAG memory

Explains changes in plain language

8. Evidence Collection Agent

Goal

Collect and organize evidence from multiple web portals for audits or inquiries.

Agentic traits

Decides what is relevant evidence

Tags metadata automatically

Avoids redundant data collection

9. Incident Timeline Reconstruction Agent

Goal

Reconstruct a timeline of UI-visible changes during an incident window.

Agentic traits

Time-aware reasoning

Cross-run memory usage

Explains causality, not just sequence

4️⃣ Technology / QA / Engineering Use Cases
10. Functional Test Generation Agent

Goal

Explore an application UI and generate meaningful functional test cases.

Agentic traits

Discovers workflows autonomously

Learns UI patterns

Generates tests without scripts

11. Regression Intelligence Agent

Goal

Distinguish real regressions from harmless UI changes.

Agentic traits

Semantic UI comparison

Memory of past releases

Confidence-based classification

12. Release Readiness Validation Agent

Goal

Validate that critical workflows still function after deployment.

Agentic traits

Goal-based validation

Dynamic replanning on failures

Produces go/no-go assessment

5️⃣ Knowledge & RAG-Driven Use Cases
13. Semantic Search Agent (Browser + Docs)

Goal

Answer questions using information spread across pages, PDFs, and past runs.

Agentic traits

Decides what to ingest

Uses RAG selectively

Explains answer provenance

14. Change Impact Explanation Agent

Goal

Explain why a change matters, not just what changed.

Agentic traits

Cross-source reasoning

Historical context

Confidence scoring

15. Knowledge Drift Detection Agent

Goal

Detect when information meaning changes over time (not formatting).

Agentic traits

Semantic comparison via embeddings

Long-term memory

Noise suppression

6️⃣ Operations & Platform Use Cases
16. Scheduled Monitoring Agent

Goal

Periodically monitor portals or dashboards and alert only on meaningful change.

Agentic traits

Autonomous scheduling

Memory-aware alerts

False-positive reduction

17. Workflow Exploration & Documentation Agent

Goal

Learn a UI workflow and generate human-readable documentation.

Agentic traits

UI exploration

Abstraction of steps

Reusable knowledge creation

18. Human-in-the-loop Review Agent

Goal

Assist humans by preparing summaries, evidence, and recommendations.

Agentic traits

Knows when to stop

Requests approval

Defers final decision

7️⃣ Why these are TRUE Agentic Use Cases (Summary)

All above use cases share these properties:

✅ Goal-driven (not step-driven)

✅ Use memory (RAG + history)

✅ Perform reasoning and evaluation

✅ Can replan dynamically

✅ Produce explanations + confidence

✅ Work identically in visible & headless modes

That’s the definition of an Agentic AI Platform.
